With Clash-Wise-AI, save time and improve coordination by creating and updating AI-powered Clash Matrices for your federated BIM model.


To create a matrix, simply choose the object categories that you want included in the clash matrix. This may take a few minutes depending on the number of categories. Youâ€™ll receive an email notification on completion.


On the web app, view your newly generated clash matrix in detail alongside AI-inferred disciplines, recommended tolerances, priority levels with guidance notes and column to add responsible contacts.


Switch to the Clash Matrix View for a dynamically generated spreadsheet with all clash rules, complete with color-coded priority levels and worksheet with responsible contacts. Easily download this spreadsheet to review locally, share with project members, or include as part of your BIM requirements.


As the project evolves, simply update the matrix from Navisworks!.


With Clash-Wise-AI, creating and managing clash matrices has never been easier. Save time, improve coordination, and ensure that every clash is addressed by the right team. Get started today and take your BIM coordination to the next level.
